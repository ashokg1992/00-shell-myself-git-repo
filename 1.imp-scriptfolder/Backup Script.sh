1. Backup Script
Script
#!/bin/bash
SOURCE="/home/ubuntu/aditya"
DESTINATION="/home/ubuntu/jaiswal/"
DATE=$(date +%Y-%m-%d_%H-%M-%S)

# Create backup directory and copy files
mkdir -p $DESTINATION/$DATE
cp -r $SOURCE $DESTINATION/$DATE
echo "Backup completed on $DATE"
Explanation
• SOURCE: The directory to be backed up.

• DESTINATION: The directory where the backup will be stored.

• DATE: Captures the current date and time to create a unique backup folder.

• mkdir -p $DESTINATION/$DATE: Creates the backup directory if it does not exist.

• cp -r $SOURCE $DESTINATION/$DATE: Copies the contents of the source directory to the backup directory.

• echo "Backup completed on $DATE" : Outputs a message indicating the completion of the backup.



Scheduling with Cron
To run the backup script at regular intervals, use crontab -e to edit the crontab file and add:
* * * * * /path/to/backup_script.sh
This example runs the script every minute. Adjust the schedule as needed.
