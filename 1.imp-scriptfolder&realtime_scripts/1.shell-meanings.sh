%T+: This prints thelast modification time of the file in a specific format. %T+ formats the time as YYYY-MM-DD+HH:MM:SS. For example, 2024-06-28+12:34:56.
%p: This prints the file's path.
\n: This prints a newline character, ensuring each file is printed on a new line.
So, -printf '%T+ %p\n' tells find to print each file's last modification time followed by its path, with each file's information on a new line.
