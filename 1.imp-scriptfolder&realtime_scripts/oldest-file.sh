# Explanation:
# Replace path/to/your/directory with the actual path of the directory you want to search.

# find "$dir" -type f -printf '%T+ %p\n': Finds all files (-type f) in the directory and prints their last modification time (%T+) and path (%p).
# sort: Sorts the files by their modification time.
# head -n 1: Takes the first line from the sorted output, which corresponds to the oldest file.
# awk '{print $2}': Extracts the file path from the output.
# Check if a file was found:

# If no file is found, it prints a message saying no files were found. Otherwise, it prints the path of the oldest file.
